# etchie
etchie is a wip zero javascript hugo theme forked from [archie](https://github.com/athul/archie).

# Desclaimer
lineNumbersInTable in markup.highlight should always be set to false,
since it breaks few css items: overflow-x in pre, background-color in code
It also means that you can't use linenos=table in highlight shortcode.

Maybe I can fix the latter , but I have no idea on fixing the former. Sorry!

# TODO
- [ ] lint html files
- [ ] modify all CSS values to be good-looking & readable
